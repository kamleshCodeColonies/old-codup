                    A fast-growing software startup was experiencing
                    difficulties in managing its daily operations. The company
                    was struggling with resource allocation, project management,
                    and team communication, which were causing delays in project
                    timelines and low morale among employees. Codup was
                    approached to help identify the problems and devise
                    solutions to improve the situation.
